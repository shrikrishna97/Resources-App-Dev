# Day 0: MAD2 – Project Creation

Go through all the important project-related documents from **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQz6txfQ1uUWTSRA76OpCl5bzm4NMHPwi_8QKkajozQ3rvfIyr3VX1K2xLoXygW6epe0HDVdKwc8RKK/pub)**.

## Important Documents

The key documents you should focus on are:

* **Project Statement** – To understand *which project* you are expected to build for the current term.
* **Project Document** – To understand the *rules and guidelines* applicable for the current term.
* **Milestone Document** – To get an idea of *how to start* and *how to structure* your project work.

For now, this is sufficient. We will look at other relevant documents once we are done building the application.

## Live Sessions

Live sessions will be conducted **every Friday starting from 13th February**.

If your submission deadline is **10th March**, please go through the **previous term’s playlist** to understand how to approach and build a MAD2 project.

## What’s Next?

On **Day 1**, we will:

* Discuss the **current term project statement**
* Go through the **project document** and **milestone document**
* Address **project-related doubts**
* If time permits, discuss **which problem statement** we will work on during the sessions for this term

**P.S.:** I will be using the **Vehicle Parking App** as the reference example for this term’s project sessions.
